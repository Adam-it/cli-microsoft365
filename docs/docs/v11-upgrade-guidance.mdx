# v11 Upgrade Guidance

The v11 release of CLI for Microsoft 365 introduces several breaking changes. To assist you in upgrading to the latest version, we've outlined the changes and the actions you may need to take.

## SharePoint

### `spo homesite set` no longer adds new home sites

The [spo homesite set](./cmd/spo/homesite/homesite-set.mdx) command has been updated to only modify existing home sites. It will no longer add a new site as home site if you don't have any configured yet.

#### What action do I need to take?

- **For adding new home sites**: Use the new [spo homesite add](./cmd/spo/homesite/homesite-add.mdx) command instead
- **For updating existing home sites**: Continue using [spo homesite set](./cmd/spo/homesite/homesite-set.mdx) as before with required option `siteUrl`.

## General

### Ensured output for `list` commands

We noticed that some of the `list` commands were not returning any output when no items were found. We've updated all `list` commands to return an empty array when no items are found.

The commands impacted by this change are:

- [spo customaction list](./cmd/spo/customaction/customaction-list.mdx)

#### What action do I need to take?

Update your scripts to expect an empty array when no items are found.

### Removed commands

Some commands were removed because their API endpoint became deprecated or the product began an end-of-life phase.

Read the documentation for alternative commands to find out how to use them and what permissions are required.
